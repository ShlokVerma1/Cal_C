---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed.
2. Save the script as `calculator.py`.
3. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
python calculator.py
```

## 🧠 Logic Overview

- The program defines individual functions for each operation.
- The `calculate()` function handles user input, processes the selected operation, and outputs results.
- The process is **interactive** and allows **repeated calculations** until the user exits.

---

## ⚙️ Dependencies

- Uses the built-in `math` module (no external dependencies).

---

## 📌 Notes

- Temperature input must be in the format like `32C` or `100F`.
- BMI takes height in **meters** and weight in **kilograms**.
- Trigonometric functions use **degree input** (not radians).
- Logarithm requires you to enter both the number and the base.
